# Automation Process Documentation â€“ 27 August 2025

## Overview
This repository demonstrates a fully automated workflow for generating, structuring, and deploying a daily Pan-African intelligence brief. The process is designed to showcase advanced automation capabilities for consulting clients seeking actionable geopolitical insights and technical excellence.

## Workflow Steps
1. **Intelligence Gathering**
   - Automated search and extraction from credible sources (Reuters, BBC, Al Jazeera, AU, CARICOM, etc.)
   - Focus on political, economic, security, and diplomatic developments across Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America, and African American communities
2. **Analysis & Structuring**
   - Cross-referencing for Pan-African connections, trade, and diplomatic ties
   - Trend analysis and strategic implications documented in `/analysis/`
   - Source links compiled in `/data/`
3. **Repository Creation & Deployment**
   - Automated creation of a new GitHub repository named by date
   - Intelligence brief published as `README.md`
   - Supporting data and analysis folders populated
4. **Documentation**
   - This file (`automation.md`) details the automation process for transparency and client demonstration

## Technical Notes
- No external APIs used; all data gathered and processed via MCP server capabilities
- All steps, from intelligence gathering to deployment, are fully automated and repeatable
- Repository structure is designed for clarity, auditability, and professional presentation
